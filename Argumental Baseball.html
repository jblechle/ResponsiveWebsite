		<h1>Acting Like A Child</h1>
			<h2>When baseball meets conflicts, conflicts turn to arguments.</h2>
		<div class="intro">
			<p id="style">Baseball is America's past time. It is a competitive sport and sometimes the competitive nature is brought out in a different kind of way for players and coaches. Close plays bring about these arguments, and a lot of times we see the players/coaches go to the extreme.</p>
		
		<p>
			<img src="http://www.tellingdad.com/wp-content/uploads/umpireyells.jpg"/> Why would someone ever act like this? It is their job and they have to do whatever they can to keep 
			Umpires are the ones who control the game. They decide balls and strikes, and safe and out calls. When there is any discrepency, out come the coaches with something to say. 
		<p>	
		<p>
			As for the people that do not understand why the coaches and players argue, lets ask ourselves this question. If your boss or co-worker blamed you for something you did not do, you would explain your reasoning to them, if they let you right? If they allow you to justify your reasoning you let them know what you have to say politely. The workforce is competitive and you do not want to lose your job for something you did not do. Now we should not take it to the extreme as the coaches do but the same goes for them. The coaches do not want to lose their jobs either, so they have to have a winning ball club to keep it. If there is a very bad call that needs to be brought up, then they will bring it up. It may not be polite because of the stress that they have to win or it is a big game for them.
